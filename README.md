# SEU_PML Dataset


### Simple introdution
SEU_PML Dataset is a Large and detailed dataset for monitoring-based traffic participants detection, jointly proposed by ***Southeast University*** and ***Purple Mountain Laboratory***

This dataset has been submitted to the journal ***Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies***

- Paper name:***《Monitoring-based Traffic Participants Detection in Multi-modal and Mixed Urban Traffic: A Large and Detailed Dataset with A Novel Detector for Small Object Detection》***

When accepted, welcome to cite our paper if you use it for your own research.

### Description

The SEU_PML dataset has the following **remarkable characteristics**: 

- (1) ***Large and detailed***. The proposed dataset contains 6,588 images shot from mixed urban traffic environments as well as 270,684 objects, which covers 4 super-categories and 13 sub-categories. In contrast to existing datasets, our dataset has more annotated objects and richer categories. Additionally, we further distinguished special vehicles (e.g., police car, ambulance, fire engineer, etc.) and construction vehicles (e.g., forklift, excavators, etc.) from other motor vehicles, aiming at serving for the tasks such as emergency vehicle preemption and construction vehicle detection. 

- (2) ***Having high-resolution images***. The image resolutions in SEU_PML vary from 1920x1080 to 4096x2160, preserving essential appearance details of traffic participants. 

- (3) ***Having high-quality labeling***. The labeling quality of SEU_PML is extremely high such that each visible object (including truncated, occluded and extremely small object) is labeled, as shown in Fig.1(h). To quantity, the labeling accuracy of SEU_PML dataset reached 98% by five rounds of manual verification and the proportion of objects whose bounding box size are less than 50 pixels reached 50%. 

- (4) ***Having rich traffic scenes***. The SEU_PML dataset has rich scenes, covering diverse types of traffic scenarios (e.g., urban intersections, arterial roads, expressways, etc.), illuminations (e.g., day, twilight, night, etc.), weathers (e.g., sunny, rainy, foggy, snowy, etc.) and so forth.


To our best knowlegment, SEU_PML Dataset is **the most detailed dataset** in all open-sourced datasets for monitoring-based traffic participants detection. 

The label quality could be seen in the figure below when compared to the existing datasets:
